Python bindings and command line tool to the Gnocchi API
========================================================

This is a client for `Gnocchi`_. There's :doc:`a Python API <api>` (the
:mod:`gnocchiclient` module), and a :doc:`command-line script <shell>`
(installed as :program:`gnocchi`). Each implements the entire Gnocchi API.

    You may want to read the `Gnocchi documentation`__ to get an idea of the
    concepts. By understanding the concepts this library and client should make
    more sense.
